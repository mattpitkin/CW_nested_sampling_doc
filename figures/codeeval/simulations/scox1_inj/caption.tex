\label{fig:scox1_inj}
Marginalised posterior plots for the recovered parameters of a simulated binary signal (with binary parameters
similar to those of the low-mass X-ray binary system Sco X-1) using simulated LIGO H1 (red) and L1 (green) data, including a joint detector analysis
(grey). The location of the simulated signal parameters are marked with a vertical black dash line or black
cross. The priors used for each parameter are shown as the dark magenta dashed lines.
