\label{fig:walkpropks}
A set of violin plots showing the distributions of Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
two-sided $p$-values comparing the posterior sample CDFs with the analytical
CDFs as a function of the prior range, when using only the ensemble walk proposal distribution. The different colour plot represent different numbers of live points used.
Offsets around the different prior range values are just used to avoid overlaps of the
distributions.
