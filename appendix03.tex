\section{Fast likelihood evaluation}\label{app:fle}

In \S\ref{sec:fastlike} we stated that the likelihood can be evaluated quickly in cases where the $\Delta\phi$ values in Equations~\ref{eq:hf}, \ref{eq:h2f}
and \ref{eq:hnongr} are zero, i.e., no phase evolution parameters are required. This can be done by pre-summing over data and combinations of the time-varying
antenna response functions, after which only coefficients of these pre-summed terms need to be calculated. Here we will explicitly write out the derivation
of these coefficients for the case of a signal in GR, for which the antenna pattern functions for the `+' and `$\times$' polarisation components are given by
\citep{1998PhRvD..58f3001J}
\begin{align}\label{eq:antenna2}
F_+(t,\psi) &= \sin{\zeta}\left[a(t)\cos{2\psi} + b(t)\sin{2\psi}\right], \nonumber \\
F_{\times}(t,\psi) &= \sin{\zeta}\left[b(t)\cos{2\psi} - a(t)\sin{2\psi}\right],
\end{align}
where $\zeta$ is the angle between the interferomter arms (which we will take as $90^{\circ}$ here, and $a(t)$ and $b(t)$ are the time varying components.
