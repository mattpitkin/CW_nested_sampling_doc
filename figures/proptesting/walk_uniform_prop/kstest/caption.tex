\label{fig:walkunipropks}
A set of violin plots showing the distributions of Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
two-sided $p$-values comparing the posterior sample CDFs with the analytical
CDFs as a function of the prior range, when using the ensemble walk and uniform proposal distributions. The different colour plot represent different numbers of live points used.
