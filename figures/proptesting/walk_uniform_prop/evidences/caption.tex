\label{fig:walkunipropevs}
A set of violin plots showing the distributions of estimates of the evidence
$\mathcal{Z}$ (as returned by our code) compared to the true evidence $\mathcal{Z}_{\rm true}$ (as
calculated using Equation~\ref{eq:kldiv}) as a function of the prior range,
or information gain, when using the ensemble walk and uniform proposal
distributions. The different colour plots represent different numbers
of live points used.
