This document describes a code to perform parameter estimation and model selection in targeted
searches for continuous gravitational waves from known pulsars using data from ground-based \gw detectors.
We describe the general workings of the code and characterise it on simulated data containing both noise and
simulated signals. We also show how it performs compared to a previous MCMC and grid-based
approach to signal parameter estimation. Details how to run the code in a variety of
cases are provided in Appendix~\ref{app:usage}.
