Posterior probability distributions for the recovered parameters of a hardware injection (named ``Pulsar05'')
into LIGO sixth science run data. The black dashed lines and black crosses represent the expected signal
parameters. Note that the probability contours for the joint detector analysis, in particular for the $\phi_0$
versus $\psi$ plot, are broader than the true distributions due to the smoothing kernel not handling the
parameter degeneracy well.
