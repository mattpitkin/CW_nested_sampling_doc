\label{fig:walkpropevs}
A set of violin plots showing the distributions of estimates of the evidence
$\mathcal{Z}$ (as returned by our code) compared to the true evidence $\mathcal{Z}_{\rm true}$ (as
calculated using Equation~\ref{eq:kldiv}) as a function of the prior range,
or information gain, when using only the ensemble walk proposal
distribution. The different colour plots represent different numbers
of live points used. Offsets around the different prior range values are just used to avoid overlaps of the
distributions.
