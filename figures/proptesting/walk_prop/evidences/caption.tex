\label{fig:walkpropevs}
A set of violin plots showing the distributions of estimates of the evidence
$\mathcal{Z}$ (as returned by our code) compared to the true evidence $\mathcal{Z}_{\rm true}$ (as
calculated using Equation~\ref{eq:testgaussev}) as a function of the prior range,
or information gain, when using only the ensemble walk proposal
distribution. The different colour plots represent different numbers
of live points used.  The error bars show the expected spread of the log evidence ratios (calculated using
$\sqrt{H/N_{\text{live}}}$, where $H$ is the information gain from Equation~\ref{eq:kldiv}) if the average estimated
evidence match the true evidence. Offsets around the different prior range values are just used to avoid overlaps of the
distributions.
