\label{fig:noise_multiparam}
Marginalised posterior probability distributions for multiple parameters of a pulsar in a binary system using simulated noise. Comparison are shown
between the posteriors output using \lppen and \lppe. Also overplotted, for the phase evolutions parameters, is the multivariate Gaussian prior distribution,
shown as dashed lines on the one-dimensional histograms and as black ellipses on the two-dimensional plots.
