\label{fig:walkunipropevs}
A set of violin plots showing the distributions of estimates of the evidence
$Z$ (as returned by our code) compared to the true evidence $Z_{\rm true}$ (as
calculated using Equation~\ref{eq:kldiv}) as a function of the prior range,
or information gain, when using the ensemble walk and uniform proposal
distributions. The different colour plots represent different numbers
of live points used.
