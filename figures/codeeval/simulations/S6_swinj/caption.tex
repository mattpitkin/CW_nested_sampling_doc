\label{fig:s6sw_inj}
Marginalised posterior plots for the recovered parameters of a simulated signal injected into data from the S6
science run: LIGO H1 (red) and L1 (green), and a joint detector analysis (grey). The location of the simulated
signal parameters are marked with a vertical black dash line or black cross. The priors used for each
parameter are shown as the dark magenta dashed lines.
