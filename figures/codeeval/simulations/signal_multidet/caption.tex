\label{fig:simsignal_multi}
Marginalised one and two-dimensional posterior probability distributions
for the parameters $\{h_0, \cos{\iota}, \psi, \Phi_{22}^C\}$
produced from the outputs of the nested sampling code \lppen, and the previous
code \lppe, when running on simulated data containing Gaussian noise and a signal 
(of coherent multi-detector SNR 8) assumed from the LIGO H1 and L1 detectors. The \lppe code was run with both an MCMC sampler mode and a grid-based
evaluation mode (shown as the black dashed line). The vertical dashed lines show the simulated signal parameter values.
