\label{fig:walkpropuls}
A set of violin plots showing the distributions of estimates of the 95\% upper limits on the Gaussian position parameter as a function of the prior range, when using only the ensemble walk proposal distribution. The different colours represent the different numbers of live points  used. The red dashed horizontal line shows the true analytical upper limit for the distribution.
Offsets around the different prior range values are just used to avoid overlaps of the
distributions.
